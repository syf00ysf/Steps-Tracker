# Steps Tracker

This project is a simple steps tracker that sorts users based on the number of steps they have taken and plots their performance over the day.

## Files

- `main.py`: This is the main file that contains all the functions.

## Functions

- `find_min_index(input_list)`: This function takes a list as input and returns the index of the smallest element in the list.

- `my_sort(user_names, user_steps)`: This function takes two lists as input: a list of user names and a corresponding list of steps taken by each user. It sorts the users based on the number of steps in ascending order and returns two lists: a list of sorted user names and a list of sorted user steps.

- `plot_line(steps)`: This function takes a list of steps as input and plots the steps over a 24-hour period.

## Usage

To use this project, run the `main.py` file. You will need to provide two lists: a list of user names and a corresponding list of steps taken by each user.

## Dependencies

This project requires Python and matplotlib.
